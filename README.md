# SpotifyData
Application that modifies Spotify data to give users a customized perspective of their Spotify usage.

# Inspiration
Every year Spotify releases the 'Wrapped' data analysis that tells people who their most listened artists, songs, etc. were for the year. Due to the fact that I use Spotify for background music when studying, the Wrapped results are not a true representation of what I actively listen to on a day-to-day basis. It would be cool to see what my results would be like if there was a way to remove certain genres or to remove a specific artist from consideration. This is what this project aspires to do! I'm going to try to see if I can grab the data of my most listened to artists, songs, etc. and try to see if I can play with the data to get a more accurate analysis of my listening habits. 

This project was inspired by my passion for music and curiosity on how I can use Spotify's API to analyze and manipulate my personal Spotify data.
